# ðŸ›’ Redux E-Commerce Practice Project

**Learning Project | Self Implementation**

This project is a **practice e-commerce application** built to understand and implement **Redux for state management** in a real-world scenario. Along with Redux, I also explored and implemented important concepts like **React Hook Form for form handling, JSON Server for backend simulation, and Nanoid for unique ID generation**.

The application allows:

* **Users** to view products and add them to the cart.
* **Admins** to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on products.

This project helped me strengthen my concepts of **state management, data flow, and frontend-backend integration** while simulating a real-world e-commerce flow.

## ðŸ“Œ Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

* Setting up and working with **Redux (store, actions, reducers, dispatch, useSelector)**.
* Managing **global state and data flow** between components.
* Implementing **CRUD operations** with a simulated backend (JSON Server).
* Using **React Hook Form** for form validation and state handling.
* Generating **unique IDs with Nanoid** in a scalable way.
* Structuring a small-scale **e-commerce app** with admin and user flows.
